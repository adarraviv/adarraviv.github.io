										<p>These hue lights (by Philips) made an excellent addition to my bedroom, where I have lights that aren’t connected to a light switch. In my particular situation, I installed them to control the lights on a ceiling fan whose only activator for the lights is the chain on the fan itself. Essentially, using these lights required me to do only two things: screw in the light and install the app.</p>
										<p>At first, I didn’t enjoy using them. I found it cumbersome to always have to unlock my phone, find the app, then turn the lights on using the app button. It really didn’t seem any easier than using the chain on the fan. In my search for an even more simple solution, I ran into the hue tap switch (also made by Philips). This hue switch addresses my initial frustration with not having an independent on/off switch for the fan light. Furthermore, unlike a traditional switch that requires wiring and drilling holes in the wall, this button uses the pressing of the button to create and store energy into its own internal battery to power itself. These remotes offer functions beyond just turning on or off lights: they can also save color settings for lights that have multiple exposure types (up to three light settings for the light they control).</p>
										<p>Naturally, I got two switches! I installed one next to my bed so that I can control the light when I wake up, and I installed the other near the entrance of my room so that I can control the lights when I enter or exit the room. My hue light is simple. Though I don’t have the fanciest hue light, there are others that come in different colors and that can be dimmed without a traditional dimmer switch. The hue light was one of the first smart home devices that I acquired, and I couldn’t be happier with its continued performance.</p>

										<p>Wemo smart light switches (by Belkin) act as a replacement for a traditional on/off switch that also allows for control through a wi-fi network. I initially purchased these switches after installing the hue light bulbs because I enjoyed the convenience of having smart lights. Since most of my lights are traditionally wired with an on/off switch, I knew that I needed a slightly different solution.</p>
										<p>However, what I didn’t know was how complicated the old wiring in my house would make setting up these switches! Now, I have BS in computer science, so I thought I could tackle something I perceived as simple, like installing a new switch--wiring thing wasn’t a new task for me. I did end up needing to invite a professional electrician to help re-educate me on my wiring knowledge. The Belkin website does state the requirements and specifications of the switch, but given my experience with installing these switches, I would suggest inviting an electrician to help out, unless you know exactly what you’re doing. For those interested, the old “serial” wiring in my house required a different linking pattern than more modern “parallel” wiring would, but my electrician knew that, thankfully!</p>
										<p>All setup aside (nothing a professional can’t handle!), these switches functioned perfectly for what I wanted. Because they function through a wi-fi network, the integrate seamlessly into many smart home control systems. I would highly recommend these switches to increase control over home lighting.</p>
