										<p>Initially, I acquired a Google Home because I was curious and thought that it would be cool to have one. I read somewhere that, unfortunately, many people end up using the Google Home as a “glorified kitchen radio.” To a certain extent, it can be used in that simple manner--it can be used as a timer, as an alarm clock, and can be verbally instructed to do simple things like provide estimated times of arrival to destinations and play music. For some people, that kind of functionality may work just fine.</p>
										<p>Where Google Home really shines is in its integration to a home network and partnering devices. Certain devices, like Google’s Chromecast can be almost completely verbally controlled through Google Home, down to being able to tell it what show or movie to play! Another fun thing that can be done with Chromecast integration, is that you can turn on the TV to which the Chromecast is connected by telling Google Home to turn on the Chromecast; it doesn’t work to turn off the Chromecast though. To read more about what the Google Chromecast can do, check our our [article on it-link].</p>
										<p>Fortunately, Google Home can also talk with another control device of mine called Harmony Hub, which can control any device that uses an infrared remotes, like a TV. So with one voice command telling Google Home to talk with Harmony Hub and turn on the TV, I can turn on the TV. With another voice command, I can tell Netflix to start broadcasting a show onto my TV. Two simple voice commands easily replaced the need to find any remote or press any button to watch a show on my TV. All I had to do was make up my mind!</p>
										<p>Setting up Google Home to a wi-fi network can be pretty simply done through the Google Home app. From there, integrating different devices is as simple as the partnering device makes it. The Google Home Mini is also an option for those who desire something even more simple and lower cost. The speaker is smaller, but the capabilities are the same. There is also a Google Home Max for those who want the most sound out of the device itself. However, since Google Home can work with devices that may have their own louder sound output, a Max may not be necessary. Needless to say, there is a lot to explore within the Google Home framework, and it’s definitely worth exploring.</p>

										<p>I adore Google’s chromecast device, and so should anyone who has a wi-fi network and a tv with an HDMI connection. Chromecast is a device that attaches to an HDMI port and uses a home wi-fi network to replicate streaming video and audio services from other devices like a smartphone, tablet, or computer. For smartphones and tablets, there is chromecast integration on many popular streaming apps like, Netflix, Hulu, HBO Now, Spotify, and Youtube. For computers, there is specialized integration on some sites, like many of the aforementioned services, while using the Google Chrome browser (using that same browser, one may replicate just about any webpage, similar to a projector--it will more successful with a more powerful computer).</p>
										<p>For apps and websites that integrate with chromecast, there will be an icon in the top right on the app or video screen that will allow broadcasting onto a TV; broadcasting is as simple as pressing the icon, choosing the Chromecast, and pressing play! The only caveat is that both the chromecast and device hosting the app or website must be connected to the same wifi network. Setup through a mobile device is pretty simple, and can be done through the google home app or through a computer. Once the chromecast is setup and connected to a wifi network, it will be visible to any capable device connected to that wi-fi network. For instance, if a friend has a chromecast setup on their wi-fi network, and you go to your friend’s house and connect to their wifi network on your smartphone, you can broadcast a Youtube video to your friend’s TV without any additional work!</p>
										<p>On some apps and websites, Chromecast integration is more complete than others. Using a smart phone with chromecast turns the phone into a simple remote for the broadcasted service, allowing you to play, pause, stop, and control volume. Using a partner device like Google Home can increase the level of functionality to include things like voice control of those same functions. With certain apps, like Netflix or HBO Now, you can even tell it what show to play! Likely, as Google Home grows in popularity, this kind of control will only increase across more apps. Because of the convenience that Chromecast offers, its ease of use, it’s expandability (you can have multiple chromecasts on the same network), and its low cost (usually about $35 for a Chromecast), I would recommend it to anyone as a gateway into home automation.</p>
